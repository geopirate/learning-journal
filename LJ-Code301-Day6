Day 6 was interesting as we're finally getting into more back end features like AJAX.  We're still using it for local calls, but we're getting there.

IFFE (ImmediatelyInvoked Function Expression) - function immediately calls itself (industry standard called "closure")
(function dog(){ console.log(woof); }())

Ternary Operators -super condensed if statement
if true ? do this : else do this
true ? cat() : dog();

Input encapsulated within label automatically associates the label with that input.
