<h1># LJ Code 301 - Day 3</h1>

<p>Things have been cruising along so far.  Most of the new stuff has been jQuery which is a lot easier to pick up than vanilla JS coming from a .net background.  The most challenging concept so far is bubbling and selecting children/parents, etc.  I still haven't fully grokked git.</p>

<h2>Reminders for git</h2>

Git command                    |  Explanation
-------------------------------|------------------
git checkout -b "branchname"   | branches the code
git pull origin master         | overwrites local data from the remote repository
git add .                      | adds all the files in the local directory for a commit
git commit -m "commit message" | commits the changes from add
git push origin "branchname"   | pushes the local changes to the remote branch
