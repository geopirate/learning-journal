<h1># LJ Code 301 - Day 1</h1>

<p>There's a lot to take in the first day of 301. I think a little more so for me because I tested out of the previous courses and I haven't been in school for a while.  I think I'll work on an additional document for people to look over for people entering the course mid stream as I'm sure it's even more daunting for people starting with 401.  Much of what I'm learning so far is more about the school, my classmates and instructors.</p>

<p>The primary lesson today is about responsive design.  This is largely a review for me as I've created responsive sites before and I had to make my submission site to test out of 201 responsive as well.  At first I thought this might be an oversight, but I think it's allowed a little more time to get acquainted with things.  The other important thing I learned today is more about what was and wasn't taught in 201.  The pair programming labs are an interesting touch, largely because it helps to get to know a classmates one on one and because it forces us to explain what we're doing as we work out problems.  I'm glad we're branching existing repositories and reading code as it's a much more realistic work flow than starting from scratch every day.</p>

<p>The lab today was about adding a few responsive elements to an unfinished website.  My partner was Mark, who also has some previous programming knowledge so we were able to do the work pretty quickly.  We actually spent most of the time figuring out the git flow.  It was pretty straightforward and we were able to get done in under an hour.</p>
