<h1># LJ Code 301 - Day 3</h1>

<p>Things have been cruising along so far.  Most of the new stuff has been jQuery which is a lot easier to pick up than vanilla JS coming from a .net background.  The most challenging concept so far is bubbling and selecting children/parents, etc.  I still haven't fully grokked git.</p>

<h2>Reminders for git</h2>
<p>git checkout -b "branchname" &emsp; branches the code
<br />git pull origin master &emsp; overwrites local data from the remote repository
<br />git add . &emsp; adds all the files in the local directory for a commit
<br />git commit -m "commit message" &emsp; commits the changes from add
<br />git push origin "branchname" &emsp; pushes the local changes to the remote branch</p>
