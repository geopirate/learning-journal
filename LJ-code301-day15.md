<h1># LJ Code 301 - Day 15</h1>

<p>Thursday, we learned about middleware, managing state and more about REST.  These topcis are more familar to me coming from a Java/C# background, but they are implemented very differently in JavaScript world</p>

<p>Friday was a review and starting off the group projects.  My group is working on an app to use the City of Seattle's data to find some soup kitchens and other facilities that provide free or low cost meals and present it in a more palatable format.</p>
